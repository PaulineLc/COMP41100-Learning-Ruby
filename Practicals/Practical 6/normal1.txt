Dear Pauline, I hope you are keeping well. As discussed earlier, the main drivers of your right sided pain are your infraspinatus and upper trapezius muscles. Your neck has settled down well since starting treatment.  If you have any questions before our next session, please do not hesitate to get in touch. I hope you have a lovely trip home to France next weekend. Kind regards
