Dear Customer, Just a reminder, your NCT test is on 04 November 2016 20:25 at our Deansgrange Test Centre. To re-arrange simply book online at http://www.ncts.ie. Please note your booking number is 44787895. If you cancel your confirmed appointment with less than five working days notice (Monday to Friday not including the day you contact NCTS) or fail to show up for the test, a €22.00 surcharge will be automatically taken from your card. A similar surcharge of €11.50 will apply in the case of a retest and both fees may be subject to change. Best of luck with your test. Yours sincerely, NCTS Customer Service Team.
